This model was created according to the paper _Inhibition of Adenylate Cyclase
Is Mediated by the High Affinity Conformation of the alpha2-Adrenergic
Receptor_ published in 1988.

The figure4 (steady state curve) in the paper has been simulated having the
same plot with Copasi 4.0.19 (development) and roadRunner(online).Because the
initial concentration of R and D were not given in the paper ,so we gave it
1e-9 Mol/L and 1e-8 Mol/L respectively.

Pay attention that the simulations of steady state concentration of species in
arbitrary units are shown for figure4 and figure6 in the paper.
